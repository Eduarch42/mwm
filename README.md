# MwM // Meta-Tilling Window Manager ![alt text][mwmkip]

## Why?
- I had a dream, where all windows where treated eqaully (almost)
- Its like tilling, but with the freadom of floating
- The lost child of bspwm and openbox
- The name looks like a face
- Is this loss?

## Features
- Included client for scripting
- Easy to read config file
- Meta-tilling 
- Minimalistic
- Dynamic window borders

## How?

## TODO
- Closing windows
- Get the functions of the main file, and make a dictionary with them, which handles them
- Borders
- Window collision
- Click to raise
- Meta-tilling
- Client
- *basically all*
